## VBA-Morse-Code: Part 1 - Morse Coder
The Morse Coder project is a VBA implementation that converts input text into Morse code. The user inputs a word, which is then converted into Morse code using a predefined mapping of letters to Morse code symbols (underscores and asterisks).

Here’s how the program works:

1. The user inputs a word in cell E7 (labeled ‘word’) of the spreadsheet, which they want to convert into Morse code.
2. The program then converts this word into Morse code, with the results displayed in column F.
3. The output Morse codes can also be exported to a text file chosen by the user.
Please note that cells A1 to B37 must be formatted as text for the program to function correctly. This project provides an interesting application of string functions and loops in VBA, making it a great learning resource for those interested in programming with VBA.

## VBA-Morse-Code: Part 2 - Morse Decoder
The second part of the project involves decoding Morse code. This is implemented through a Morse Decoder program written in VBA.

Here’s how the Morse Decoder works:

1. The user selects a text file that contains Morse code.
2. The Morse Decoder program then reads this file and decodes the Morse code contained within it.
3. The decoded word is displayed in cell E7 of the spreadsheet.
This part of the project demonstrates the reverse process of the Morse Coder, providing a comprehensive understanding of both encoding and decoding processes in Morse code. It serves as an excellent resource for those interested in learning more about data encoding and decoding using VBA.
